To convert a bitmap to a OLED Library compatible buffer array, follow the following steps:

  1. Create an image (e.g in Gimp) with a dimension of 128x64
  2. For black areas use white color, for white areas use black color
  3. Disable Antialiasing. Normally it creates feather edges but this requires a display with variable pxiel settings
  4. Save image as bmp
  5. Use LCD Assistant (http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/bitmap_converter/) to convert the bitmap into an array
     Size is 128x64
     Byte orientation is Vertical
     Pixels / Byte is 8
  6. Insert the array instead of the current buffer array
